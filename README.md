# MyoDjBuddy

Another project with the [Myo Armband](https://developerblog.myo.com/author/thalmic-labs/), this time a full-GUI program which allows the user to add synchronic beats and graphical effects to a background soundtrack.

This project was also featured on the University Robotics Lab website: https://sites.hevra.haifa.ac.il/rbd/2017/03/21/myo-dj-buddy/?lang=en
